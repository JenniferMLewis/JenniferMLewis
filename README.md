# Hello,
# My Name is Jennifer Lewis and I'm currently Studying Data Science at Codeup!
# We're Focusing on Python and SQL, and I have debugging knowlege of PHP, as well as familiarity with CSS.
# I did Analysis during my time with the Navy, and it's actually my favourite aspect of the Data Science potential.
